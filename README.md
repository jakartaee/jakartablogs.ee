# jakartablogs.ee

The [jakartablogs.ee](https://jakartablogs.ee) website is generated with [Planet Venus](https://github.com/rubys/venus).

Welcome to the blog home of open source, cloud native Java innovation! Read posts from our global community on Jakarta EE news, technologies, best practices, and compatible products.

## Aggregated Feed
Jakarta Blogs provides one aggregated feed: 
[http://feeds.feedburner.com/jakartaeeblogs](http://feeds.feedburner.com/jakartaeeblogs)

You can subscribe to the feed with your favorite feed reader or read the feed online at [Jakartablogs.ee](https://Jakartablogs.ee).

## Guidelines

We (the admins) generally ask ourselves the following questions before adding a feed to Jakarta Blogs:

* Is the feed written by a real person?
* Is the person an EE4J committer or contributor?
* Is the ratio of off-topic postings not too high?
* Are the off-topic postings covered by the Jakarta Blogs tag line?
* Does the feed add more value to Jakarta Blogs and the Jakarta EE community than it does for the feed owner?
* Is there more than just a welcome posting?
* Does the feed contain advertisements?

## How to add your blog
1. By opening a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/jakartaee/jakartablogs.ee/issues/new?template=add_blog.md)
2. By creating a pull request

The issue or pull request must include a picture (185x185), the RSS feed url for the blog and the full name of the author.

If the contributor chose to submit a pull request, this information must be added to planet/planet.ini file as follows:

~~~~
[https://blogs.eclipse.org/blog/180/feed]
name = Tanja Obradovic
picture = tanja-obradovic.jpg
~~~~

Pictures must be added to the planet/theme/authors folder.

:exclamation: **TIP:** If your blog contains other topics than Jakarta EE, use categories to filter the feed, e.g. ```<your blog>/category/jakarta-ee/feed/```.
